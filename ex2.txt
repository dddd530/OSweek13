Recovery:
It is the worst strategy because OS lets deadlock to appear and then deal with it in different possible ways.
It is better to use this strategy when deadlock are unavoidable.

Prevention:
Deadlock prevention algorithms ensure that at least one of the necessary conditions is met.
Most of prevention algorithms use resources poorly. 
Hence, it is better to use it when resource requirements are not big.


Avoidance:
Most deadlock avoidance algorithms require each process to report in advance the maximum amount of each type 
of resource it may need. Based on all this information, we can decide whether a process should wait for a resource
or not, and thus avoid the possibility of a cyclical waiting.
Is is better to use this strategy when resource requirements are big.
